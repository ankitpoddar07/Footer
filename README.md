# Footer
A piece of text, such as a page number or a title, that appears at the bottom of every page of a document: The program saves room at the top of each page of a document for a header, and at the bottom of each page for a footer.

# This footer design example is a lesson in simplicity.

It consists of a minimal number of links, a Contact Us call-to-action button on the far left of the screen, and a short social media icon block on the right.
* This footer fits in well with the rest of the design, with a clean layout and a clear call to action.
